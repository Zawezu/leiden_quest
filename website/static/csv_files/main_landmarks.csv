52.15896289011223;4.492492679291971;KPNO-Drone-360-2-CC2.jpg;Burcht van Leiden;The Burcht van Leiden is an old shell keep in Leiden constructed in the 11th century. It is located at the spot where two tributaries of the Rhine come together, the Oude Rijn and the Nieuwe Rijn [nl]. The structure is on top of a motte, and is today a public park. Originally built by Halewijn I in 1060. He was subsequently appointed viscount of Leiden by Count Dirk V of Holland. From humble beginnings, the hill was raised during various periods of history up to 9 m (30 ft) above the surrounding landscape in the 11th century. Ada van Holland used the keep as a residence until her father died in 1203 and she was captured by her paternal uncle, William I.[1] In the same year the previous stone building was rebuilt after an attack on the castle, with tuff stone, and after Ada's removal, in 1204 it was attacked again and rebuilt with brick. Later in the 13th century the building was considered antiquated, since more and more townspeople and houses were built around the base of the hill, making defenses impossible without destroying most of the city. The old "interior keep" that had been built against the interior walls (a similar rounded keep construction can still be seen in Teylingen) was slowly dismantled and reused for city construction.;de-burcht-leiden-castle-1174439236.jpg;Nice views;This castle has nice views;LmpwZw-751939872.jpg;On a hill;It is located on top of a hill;Achterzijde-van-de-Burcht-van-Leiden-cc-Johan-Bakker-e1455892041662-983266351.jpg
