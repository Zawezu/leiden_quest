That is because of their great significance to the Netherlands throughout its history. Windmills were important for the Netherlands because they were continuously used to drain water in order to keep the land dry. But they were also widely used for grinding grains and spices. Additionally, sawmills were also significant for building wooden ships on an industrial level.;MolenDeValk.jpg;;Molen De Valk is a smock mill dating from 1743. It was the last original mill of the nineteen that stood on Leiden's city walls. After the death of the last miller, the mill became a museum in 1966. The only remaining town miller's house in the Netherlands exudes the atmosphere of around 1900.

52.15896289011223;4.492492679291971;KPNO-Drone-360-2-CC2.jpg;De Burcht Van Leiden;Leiden Castle is one of the oldest surviving examples of a castle in the Netherlands. It stands on a motte, an artificial hill, and was part of a motte-and-bailey castle.The castle's history begins in the 9th and 10th centuries, when a palisade-enclosed refuge was built at this location: the "Leitheriburch." Here, people and livestock could seek refuge from danger. Around the year 1000, a wooden building already stood there, and in the centuries that followed, the hill was further raised to approximately 10 meters above its surroundings.Under Count Dirk VI, the wooden fence was replaced by a tuff stone ring wall. The location was strategically chosen: precisely where the Rhine, Mare, and Vliet rivers meet.;DeBurchtvanLeiden1.jpg;Medieval power and special stories;The castle first appears in written sources in the 12th century. Burgraves such as Alwinus Castellanus and later Jacob van Leiden had their seat here and held important rights, such as collecting taxes and appointing the bailiff and aldermen.The castle played a role in several historical events, including the battle for Ada of Holland (1203–1204). During this Loon War, the structure suffered severe damage, after which it was repaired with monastery bricks. Around 1275, the ring wall was rebuilt again, possibly at the behest of Floris V.;DeBurchtvanLeiden2.jpg;Archaeological discoveries;Over the years, extensive archaeological research has been conducted on the castle. Excavations confirm that the mound was entirely artificial and has undergone multiple construction phases dating back to the early Middle Ages. Although isolated finds sometimes appear older—such as a Roman coin—the structures indicate that the mound's origins lie in the 9th or 10th century.;DeBurchtvanLeiden3.jpg;Go to Pieterskerk;Go to the castle;52.15793389059463;4.487722834145332
